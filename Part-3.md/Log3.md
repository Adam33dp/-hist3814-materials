# Name of Tutorial: Twine

+ This one was the most interesting one so far, and had a lot of fun doing the tutorial and building my own short game as well.
+ The tutorial was rather easy to follow although I did run into a little trouble with some of the codes
+ So the first step was to essentially copy and paste codes from the site into the twine site itself.
+ It was fun as this was the first time I ever created a game before
+ It gives you options to create different scenarios that effect the outcome of the game for the player
+ It also gives you the ability to give and take away certain traits from the player depending on which option they choose in the game
+ After the tutorial I played around in Twine for a little longer (roughly 3 hours) building my own game but, which was very interesting but once I saw the time I decided that was enough for now
+ I did not complete my version but I did add it to my repo and plan on finishing it on my free time as that was fun
+ adding it into Github now was a struggle Professor Grant sent me to a static tutorial which got me further but still gave me some problems when uploading ![Error message](https://github.com/Adam33dp/-hist3814-materials/blob/main/Part-3.md/twine%20problem.jpg)
+ Taking a break on that one for now

#Name of Tutorial : Story Maps with Knightlab

+ This one was fun it brings you to a website called Knightlab where you create a storymap where you can add all the places you have been or find interesting.
+ The tutorial walks you through how to create your slides
+ I started off with looking up addresses for some of my favorite places in Ottawa
+ Then I looked up photos of those places that look nice and would attract people to those places
+ Finally I created a slide for each of those places, adding in their locations, photos, as well a short paragraph on my own personal description of the place

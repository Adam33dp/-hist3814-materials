# Name of Tutorial: Twine

+ This one was the most interesting one so far, and had a lot of fun doing the tutorial and building my own short game as well.
+ The tutorial was rather easy to follow although I did run into a little trouble with some of the codes
+ So the first step was to essentially copy and paste codes from the site into the twine site itself.
+ It was fun as this was the first time I ever created a game before
+ It gives you options to create different scenarios that effect the outcome of the game for the player
+ It also gives you the ability to give and take away certain traits from the player depending on which option they choose in the game
+ After the tutorial I played around in Twine for a little longer (roughly 3 hours) building my own game but, which was very interesting but once I saw the time I decided that was enough for now
+ I did not complete my version but I did add it to my repo and plan on finishing it on my free time as that was fun
+ adding it into Github now was a struggle Professor Grant sent me to a static tutorial which got me further but still gave me some problems when uploading ![Error message](https://github.com/Adam33dp/-hist3814-materials/blob/main/Part-3.md/twine%20problem.jpg)
+ Taking a break on that one for now
+ So after several tries me and the Prof were able to work it out
+ I had to make sure that I was using a clean new repo and that all the settings were exactly correct
+ I had to set my repo to public and set up a page to be viewed on the open web and now the game can be accessed on that page which was really nice

#Name of Tutorial : Story Maps with Knightlab

+ This one was fun it brings you to a website called Knightlab where you create a storymap where you can add all the places you have been or find interesting.
+ The tutorial walks you through how to create your slides
+ I started off with looking up addresses for some of my favorite places in Ottawa
+ Then I looked up photos of those places that look nice and would attract people to those places
+ Finally I created a slide for each of those places, adding in their locations, photos, as well a short paragraph on my own personal description of the place

#Name of Tutorial : Point Map with Google Maps

+ This tutorial went well with the last one from Knightlab, and will be interesting to use whenever going on a road trip or  simply plotting different attractions that I want to visit.
+ The first part of the tutorial has you download a set of Parks and Museums from and Excel sheet and for some reason I could not dowload it from the recents folder like the instructions said so I just downloaded it to Excel then imported it from there
+ It than has you create different markers for each attraction by going through and because the markers were already in seperate columns for Parks and Museums, this was easy as you could only change two instead of six.
+ It then walks you through how to customize the page with pictures of each location in order to help with the description
+ At the end it asks you to save your new map with an HTML which is super handy as that provides future work is possible

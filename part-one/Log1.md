First thing I did was join the class discord as it seems like reaching out for help and talking as a group is a major part of this class.
Second thing was download Atom as the instructions state that Sublime will ask you to register which I think will be unnecessary.
Sequence I intend to follow is the newcomer Sequence this is because I am pretty bad with technology, but it's nice to see I can change later if I start to become more familiar.

# Name of Tutorial: Markdown

 + Markdown was difficult and I was challenged with inserting the image as I was putting just the URL so it was bringing up the website which it was located on.
 + But than chatting with the Prof on discord he put me on the right track.
 + So I had to use the URL of the actual picture itself and than that worked better.
 + It was also perfect timing as Torin a classmate was running into the same problem, and we got it figured out over discord.

# Name of Tutorial: Github

+ This was relatively easy to set up, it took me a little longer than expected but I didn't run into any major problems.
+ I worked through the tutorial logged in set up my first repository and set Professor Graham as a collaborator.
+  I went through and learned how to add files into GitHub as well. It took me a few minutes to set up the folders but either than that it wasn't too bad considering my horrible computer skills.
+  I can see how it will be a valuable resource for all my material for the course.

# Name of Tutorial: Digital History Analytical Toolkit.

+ Now this one was challenging, I started by installing MiniConda, Python and R studio. Everything loaded up pretty easily except for R studio it kept giving me an error message.![Error message](https://github.com/Adam33dp/-hist3814-materials/blob/main/part-one/error%20message%20R%20studio%20mini%20one.jpg)
+ I asked professor Graham if he had seen that before and he was able to find out that it was because I had already downloaded it and was attempting to do it twice.
+  I than found R studio in my files and was able to open it.
+ I than played around with Miniconda again as the tutorial insisted and it was rather interesting.

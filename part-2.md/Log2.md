**Excel**

+ When I first booted up Excel (seeing as it has been a while since I used it) the data was uploaded easily which was nice
+ But I ran into a little difficulty when trying to find the sum
+ I tried to highlight the numbers unsuccessfully until I realized I have to go to the top editing icon and use the sum functio from there which worked and I got the correct sum into the correct unsuccessfully
+ Creating the initial chart was rather easy as the instructions were quite clear I just highlighted the data and went to recommended charts and created a bar graph

**R studio**

+ I had trouble with R studio before so it was nice to see it uploaded fine the first time here
+ I put the first two lines into R install.packages("RCurl") and library("RCurl") which I think worked out fine but it did take me some time to find where it was in the central R depository
+ I did run into trouble with the next step but I put in the second code which was the direct web address and it seemed to work out better
+ I realized once I tried to pull the data that I needed to install another R Tools, which I may have done incorrectly ![Error message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adam33dp/-hist3814-materials/main/part-2.md/R%20studio%20Mini%20one.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABUFFQNKKOTTPIUIDNGLD54AYUD3GUQ)

+ I reached out to Prof. Graham last week about R Studio and he sent me a cloud version so I'll try that one to see if that works better
+ quickly went through the first few steps again this R Studio is a web based one and not downloaded onto my computer but seems to work for now
+ The data appeared now which was a major relief and I was able to create the tables and graphs from the tutorial

+ Done with R studio ready to move on Wget, but I'll save that for tomorrow and a new set of eyes

**Wget**
* This one gave me some trouble, first I wasn't sure how to make sure that is successfully downloaded but Professor Graham informed me that you had to access it through the command prompt and that was how I would know it downloaded successfully

* Than I was not able to have it come up in my command prompt, I was able to fix this after finding some answers online which essentially had me go through my Control Panel and manually give it permission to open up
* ![Error message](https://github.com/Adam33dp/-hist3814-materials/blob/main/part-2.md/wget%20problems%20mini%20version.jpg)
* I successfully opened the website URL's which was a major relief and kind of cool to see them pop up
* And for my computer I have to type in Wget.exe for it to work which I found out the hard way
* The rest of the tutorial went rather smoothly (which was rare) and I was able to successfully create the war-diaries directory and upload all the URL's into it as well
* This might have been one of the most stressful systems so far but I can definitely see the potential for using Wget outside this class when finding things on the open web
